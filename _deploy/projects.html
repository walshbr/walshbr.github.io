  <p>While the blogroll has miscellaneous scribblings, these are the more complete/robust projects that I have worked on. In addition to my work on projects at <a href="http://scholarslab.virginia.edu">Scholars’ Lab</a> and <a href="https://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu">DH at W&amp;L</a>, I also maintain a <a href="https://www.github.com/walshbr">github repository</a> where I regularly contribute code for a range of projects in a variety of stages of completeness.</p>

<h2>Hearing Silent Woolf</h2>

<p><img class="small right" src="/assets/images/woolf.jpg" alt="woolf face" /></p>

<p>Python project that uses natural language processing and machine learning to perform distant readings of Virginia Woolf’s use of quotation marks. The study aims to chart Woolf’s use of moments that imply speech even when no punctuation is present. The project won first prize for the digital humanities panel I was on at the <a href="http://gradcouncil.com/2015-sessions/">2015 Huskey Research Exhibition at UVA</a>, and it was the basis for a fellowship in digital humanities in UVA’s <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>. The project was carried out with significant contributions from Eric Rochester, Head of Research and Development in the Lab, and our code can be found on our <a href="https://www.github.com/walshbr/woolf">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Prism</h2>
<p><img class="mid right" src="/assets/images/digital-projects/prism.png" alt="prism visualize page" />
<a href="http://www.prism.scholarslab.org">Prism</a> is a browser-based Ruby on Rails application that facilitates text analysis among large groups of people. Built by the <a href="http://www.praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> at the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>. I came on during the second year of development and have served lead developer since (though the tool is no longer in active development). The tool has gotten significant uptake by K-12 educators.</p>

<h2>Humanities Programming</h2>
<p><img class="mid right" src="/assets/images/humanities_programming.png" alt="Humanities Programming course splash page." /></p>

<p>Each summer I run a course on “Humanities Programming” at <a href="https://dhtraining.org/">Humanities Intensive Learning and Training (HILT)</a>. Piloted by Wayne Graham and Jeremy Boggs, I took over and now lead the course with Ethan Reed. The course is meant to be an intensive introduction to programming for non-programmers that takes students through command line, git, HTML5/CSS, Ruby, and Rails. By the end, students will have tinkered on and deployed their own Ruby on Rails application. Materials can be found on our <a href="https://humanitiesprogramming.github.io">course site.</a></p>

<h2>NINES</h2>
<p><img class="mid right" src="/assets/images/nines.png" alt="NINES splash page" /></p>

<p>From 2013 to 2015 I acted as Project Manager of the <a href="http://www.nines.org">Networked Infrastructure of Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES)</a>. NINES peer reviews digital archives pertaining to the nineteenth-century and aggregated that content into a federated, searchable index. As Project Manager I facilitated this process by wrangling reviewers, cleaning metadata, and facilitating the indexing process.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Text Analysis: A Coursebook</h2>
<p><img class="mid right" src="/assets/images/coursebook.png" alt="Introduction to text analysis: a coursebook" />
<a href="http://walshbr.com/textanalysiscoursebook/">Introduction to Text Analysis: A Coursebook</a> is an open, remixable set of course materials. Co-authored with Professor Sarah Horowitz of Washington and Lee University, the book is designed to be modularized so as to facilitate easy excerpting. The book was written with a student audience in mind, and it is as much a pedagogical experiment in collaborative writing as it is a teaching resource in its own right.</p>

<h2>Doctoral Dissertation</h2>
<ol>“AudioTextual: Modernism, Sound Recordings, and Networks of Reception”<br /><br />
This project examines how Anglo-American modernists engaged with new devices for sound recording and the threats and opportunities these media offered for community, the page, and the embodied voice. The project at once shows the still unrecognized extent of the modernist encounter with new technologies of sound and listens closely to audio recordings of modernist works as they form a network of modernist distribution and reception that transcends accounts limited by genre and nation. By rereading classic audible moments from modernist works in light of these sound recordings, the project argues for greater dialogue between literary modernism and its audiotextual incarnations that unfold over the course of decades and that consistently re-evaluate the terms and provocations of the original print works.<br /><br />
Committee: Michael Levenson, Jahan Ramazani, Rita Felski, Michael Puri<br /><br />

<h2>Master’s Thesis</h2>
<ol>“Noise and the Novel: The Sound of Literary Modernism”<br /><br />
This study examines the works of Conrad, Joyce, and Woolf with special attention to the sociohistorical contexts of sound production and reception. With reference to cognitive psychology and contemporary folk music and noise legislation, the project ultimately argues that a new “aesthetics of noise” reoriented conditions of labor, community, and the body. <br /><br />
