I've always been someone who learns best while listening. And as I've gotten older and busier, I've had more and more need to find ways to keep up with work while taking care of other things. In the last couple years I've started to do a deep dive into the DH resources out there available as audio, things that I can absorb during the cracks of the day. 

Keep in mind there is no real attempt at coverage here: it roughly collects whatever I've managed to find whenever I manage to check it out. So, the list is always going to be incomplete but be growing over time. The scope is also quite broad but also idiosyncratic: there's a clear focus on DH infrastructure and digital pedagogy given my own work. And I also won't be keeping track, say, if things get taken down years from now. 

What follows is my running list of recordings. There's no real distinction made below between, say, podcasts you could download on your phone and videos that need to be run in the browser. Such a difference is meaningful but doesn't really fit my own particular purposes here, so if you have need or one or the other you will have to poke around a bit. 

## Tech Specs

I'm using a service called [BibBase](https://bibbase.org/) to embed my Zotero collection on this page, so this post should be updated in the future as that collection updates. I would recommend [this guide](https://yvonneseale.org/blog/2016/10/23/how-to-embed-a-zotero-bibliography-in-a-web-page/
) by Yvonne Seale if you want to embed a Zotero bibliography in this same way on a page of your own. 

There's some weirdness in how the metadata gets ported outwards 

## Credits 

I also particularly want to shout out Merisa Martinez who shared a [list of their favorite DH podcasts](https://dhcommons.hypotheses.org/451) a few years ago. Thanks also to Amanda Visconti for suggesting some links on Mastodon. I've included those links in the Zotero collection below. And you! Since my initial blog post on this work I have moved the list from a personal collection to a [zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5625243/digital_humanities_on_the_go). That means that anyone can join the zotero group and start adding recordings of your own. If you do so please get in touch so I can credit you accordingly.

something is going on with the calls here - it's getting hung up and stopping. not sure if it is the bibtex or what. next steps to troubleshoot i think might involve changing which zotero collection you are pointing to and then maybe adjusting the zotero metadata to see if it's a single item causing problems
