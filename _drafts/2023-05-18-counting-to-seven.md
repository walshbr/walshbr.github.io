Some disciplines, especially, may rely more on lecture-based approachs to instruction than conversation. This means that when working with students on DH pedagogy, one common question I get is how to run a classroom discussion. Doing so can feel totally new for students unfamiliar to the format. Here's a short little trick you can use across topics and methods, including in DH. 

For a new instructor, silence can be terrifying. When you ask a question and no one responds the instinct might be to answer it yourself. This loop can create a space in which one gestures towards a discussion without actually giving the students space to speak up. You get what is essentially a lecture with performative discussion elements.Sometimes you do need to jump in. But often students actually need space to thinkâ€“the silence in the room can be productive. The trick is to learn how to sit with it. I use a tactic that I've heard framed in different ways by a number of people, but I associate it most with a Sophia Gu, a former colleague of mine in the UVA English Department. It's a pretty simple loop that you put into play whenever you ask a question in the classroom:

1. Ask a question to prompt discussion.
2. If you get a response, great! Move on.
3. If you get no response, count slowly to seven. Take a drink of water, stare at the ceiling, or otherwise busy yourself.
4. If you still get no response, reframe or clarify the question.
5. Count to seven again. 
6. If you get to seven and still get no response you answer the question yourself.

I find that the simple fact of having a plan for the silence makes it much more manageable. It gives students the space to ask questions and gives your classroom the chance to have a real discussion.
