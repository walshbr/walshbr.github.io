I used to blog regularly, but that publishing schedule happened roughly whenever I felt like it. During the pandemic I experienced a series of personal and professional challenges that caused me to slow things down considerably across the board. The result was that my writing schedule ceased–I simply did not have the energy to blog on top of other things. This past summer I set a goal for myself to blog once per week as a means of trying to force myself back into a blogging mindset. Having now (thankfully) finished, I wanted to reflect a bit back on the experience as a means of putting a button on the sprint.

## Weekly posts

Publishing weekly is too much. Anyone could have told me this. I even would have advised myself against it. I usually tell my students to aim for regular posts to blogs or social media on a sustainable basis, a steady trickle rather than an intermitent flood. But the crunch of this writing push was quite intentional. I'm a very process-oriented person, relying on regular daily practices as opposed to big sprints on things. I live my work life out in pomodoros. I wrote most of my dissertation at 5:00 AM in 750-word-a-day chunks ([using an online system that rewarded me with kitten photos with each milestone](https://writtenkitten.co/)). This probably goes back to an old adage I heard learning music growing up that it's better to practice every day for an hour than for seven hours once a week. My hope was that a weekly posting schedule would force me into a daily writing practice of some shape. This worked to a degree, though of course with the needs of daily life such a schedule is unsustainable. I settled into a regular practice of returning to writing in a few inconsistent and intermittment sessions per week. Perhaps most importantly, I started to divide those sessions between writing, proofing, prepping, and publishing in ways that worked well. I'm an endless tinkerer, and it's easier for me to hold myself back if I know I'm not supposed to be adding new content when I sit down. 

## Scale, genre

Another side effect (expected and experienced) of the sprint was that I found myself writing different kinds of things than had been my habit in recent years. I wanted to use the summer to push myself towards different scales in part to prove to myself that not everything needed to be a big Statement™. This experiment was largely successful–I found myself posting on tool tips, resources I was putting together, one-off teaching exercises, and generally just documenting a lot of approaches I take to conversations 1:1 with students. New topics also brought new lengths. I was pleased to see an estimated reading time of one minute on one post. I have always loved this about blogging–that the genre is what you make of it–but it was a lesson I had started to forget over the years. I also found myself more likely to bring in my other interests–music most often–that might otherwise get left out of DH pieces. In short, the need to publish pulled me along the path to innovation. I used to write blog posts one at a time, but I developed a habit this summer of having several posts in various stages of publication at once. Some of my writing time was spent just brainstorming a list of topics and titles for future posts, which I found useful for providing a well I could return to periodically for new ideas. This process was very different from my old approach to developing new posts, where I waited to feel like I had a complete statement before writing.

## Platforms

For years, Twitter was my main connection to the larger DH community, both to share my own work and to see what was going on in the field. I never felt that I was consistently active on the platform, but I had accumulated a modest following of ~2900 people over the course of the last decade. This summer's writing sprint coincided neatly with Twitter's ongoing implosion due to Musk's mismanagament. I've largely refrained from posting there for a few months as the ties between the app and far-right politics felt increasingly difficult to ignore. Where has my own community gone since Twitter? How would I find them? Quinn Dombrowski has [posted](https://quinndombrowski.com/blog/2022/11/30/month-mastodon-what-are-we-doing/) about their experiments building community on Mastodon, and I've been exploring that space slowly and haphazardly. And my colleague [Will Rourke](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/people/will-rourk/) has found some exciting success posting about his 3D scanning with his students on LinkedIn. Which of these platforms would work for me?

The writing sprint gave me an opportunity to test my own network and try to answer some of these questions for myself. I signed up for TinyAnalytics, a free and privacy-conscious alternative to Google Analytics. Each time I posted, I shared the link using the same langauge to the same set of platforms:

* the #community channel shared by the UVA Library and the Scholars' Lab slack teams
* Mastodon (I'm on the instance run by [Humanities Social](https://hcommons.social/))
* Facebook
* LinkedIn

There are all sorts of issues with this "study" of mine. I was fairly new to Mastodon when I started this series. I've been on Facebook for years but my community there consists mostly of friends along with the occasional DH colleagues I'm closer with. And I've largely just had a placeholder LinkedIn profile. While there is nothing rigorous about the analytics here, I still found it interesting to note how my traffic broke down. The experiment has also brought interesting moments of overlap between the different communities that would never had taken place under my old twitter-first approach.[^1]

As best I can figure it, "direct" referrers comprises both Mastodon and Slack traffic. Of that, I assume it's mostly Mastodon. It's very interesting to me to note that Mastodon, even though my community is comparatively new and in formation there, is still responsible for the bulk of the traffic to my site. This comports with my understanding of the platform. Even though the platform is newer and my community smaller, the people there seem more likely to engage than people ever were on Twitter. Smaller audience, higher impact. 

## Is it a series?

Multiple people across platforms commented on this on the ongoing writing with version of "I'm enjoying this series!" Comments like that were, of course, appreciated. But they got me thinking about the point at which a collection coheres. I've had the goal of blogging my way towards a book proposal for a while, and some of the things I wrote about were in that direction. But, in other ways, the posts I wrote this summer felt like a pretty loosely associated set of topics only connected by my own interests. Does it matter if your writing coheres across pieces? Does it do so simply by virtue of occurring in the same space in a compressed space? Is a snapshot of writing at a particular point in time useful on its own?

## Next steps

I'll be slowing down considerably after today–the weekly pace was never intended to be an ongoing thing, though I might return to it next summer given the rhythms of my work life. I'll be hoping to find regular intervals that keep the writing alive that won't burn me out. In the future I'm going to downgrade to probably biweekly at most, monthly posting more likely. I'll be continuing to blog towards a [book project](https://walshbr.com/blog/year-of-book-blogging-digital-humanities-pedagogy-in-kind/) around digital humanities pedagogy. And I'll keep experimenting with scale and form. If you've made it this far thanks for reading!

**Maybe share the ToC for the post? Or should that be its OWN post?**
