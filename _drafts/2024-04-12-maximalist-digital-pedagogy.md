I've long tried to do less in my teaching. Fewer readings, less technology, smaller scale. For me, these always lead to impact–a deeper experience for students, richer conversations, a more sustainable classroom. Danica Savonick has a wonderful summary of her particular take on minimalist digital humanities pedagogy [over on JITP](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/teaching-dh-on-a-shoestring-minimalist-digital-humanities-pedagogy/section/c9b61bdc-77a6-4283-9a01-5aab70730508). For her, minimalist DH pedagogy is a set of "strategies for teaching DH at institutions that don't have many resources for doing so" by favoring free or low-cost tools. We could bring together a cluster of related ideas to extend this conversation. Paul Fyfe on [digital pedagogy unplugged](https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000106/000106.html) or Jentery Sayers on [low-tech approaches to digital research](https://jentery.github.io/lowtech/#/title) as a way to center the underlying conversations behind the technology. Fyfe again on [mid-sized digital pedagogy](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/ca25a1d8-3e38-46bf-a456-870bc008eac6) as a way to think through teaching through the the continuum of what scale can be. John E. Russell and Merinda Kaye Hensley on [buttonology](https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.78.11.588) as a way of thinking about teaching that over-emphasizes interfaces at the expense of critical thinking. For me, a minimalist approach to teaching digital humanities can be thought of as a generalized approach to the work that we do, a pursuit of the best possible teaching by creatively working at, across, and in spite of resource limitations. Pursuing less is often the pursuit of reality, to match my teaching to my own lived experiences as well as to that of my students. A way of seeking safety. A jog instead of a sprint. In most cases, that struggle is absolutely necessary, even if it's not always possible to succeed given the day-to-day circumstances of working in higher education. 

More on the merits of minimalism in a future post though. For now, I want to write a bit about a related problem that I've been pondering as I try to theorize about minimalist DH teaching. What are these approaches writing against? How much of this is explicit and how much might be unexamined in DH teaching? How might **more** illuminate what we mean by **less**? 

How would we characterize a maximalist approach to digital humanities pedagogy? 

Marília Matoso has a [succint summary of maximalism](https://www.archdaily.com/1007027/maximalism-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-to-know-it) as a design aesthetic on ArchDaily. It's an approach that favors more, organized excess, divergent patterns, and conflicting personalities: "it celebrates imprecision, embraces diversity, blurs the lines between reality and fantasy, encourages spontaneity, and champions freedom of expression." It's a lot, and that's by design. Here's a photo from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) tagged as maximalist.

I've been able to find very few people writing about maximalism in the context of education (if you have other sources let me know!). Paul Emerich France theorizes maximalism in the classroom in negative terms as an approach that stuffs more in wherever possible–more activities, more topics, more attention–in a way that is unsustainable. [Richard Paul](https://doi.org/10.1080/10790195.1988.10849927) uses the terms differently: minimalist approaches to teaching focus on the educational environment itself–what do  to learn to pass a test–while maximalist pedagogy is concerned with the transfer of academic lessons to the broader world. By his own admission, though, maximalist goals are something of an ideal to aspire to, as institutions are limited by the infrastructure they have: "It's not fair to expect a center to accomplish maximalist ends with a minimalist budget" (126). 

My knee-jerk theorization of a maximalist approach to DH is a starkly negative one: I've seen too much pain from unsustainable approaches to teaching and practicing DH. Resource scarcity is, I would wager, far more the rule than the exception in education. Whether it is the time-pressed and overworked instructor at a teaching-intensive institution, the under-resouced and over-tired K-12 educator, or the over-stretched digital humanities campus coordinator–rarely do we have enough, let alone space for more. Teachers in these contexts requires a certain kind of teaching because it is the only way to survive. 

I need to do more thinking, and I'll doubtless put a caveat on this post in the future as I do so. But as of right now, my take might be summed up as this: maximalist digital humanities pedagogy is an approach to DH teaching and learning that aims for more as a virtue in itself. To be clear: I believe this approach is most often **unexamined**, as my underlying assumption here is that many new to the field or to teaching the topic might default to this approach out of insecurity. After all, teaching towards less takes discipline. Rest requires restraint. That is to say, maximalist digital pedagogy often operates without consideration of the costs, limits, or wisdom of scale. But many are forced into this pedagogical position, whether by the institution, by collaborators, or external factors outside of their control. Instructors in a position of scarcity are forced to maximize. So, we might update our definition to say that a maximalist digital pedagogy might be a circumstance, an institutional context, as much as a teacherly approach. We would do less **if we could**, but the gravitational pull is towards more.

I could keep going. But, after all, this is meant to be a blog post in the direction of a future longer piece–not the longer project itself. As I keep working on the topic I'll want to think more about how to nuance this theory. In particular, my readings on design maximalism brought out many positive characteristics: joy, abundance, diverse points of view, democracy, acceptance, and more. How might we square these with an operational theory of maximalist digital pedagogy, one that has to operate within the limits of our classrooms, our institutions, our lives? For now, I will close with a series of provocations that, to me, ring of a maximalist digital pedagogy as I currently understand it. Think of these in the spirit of the [Cult of Done Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13). The following messy, impartial list is meant to elicit reflection and pause. Think of it as a list of things that, when I see them, make me raise an eyebrow and wonder if maximalism has snuck into the room.

A Maximalist Digital Humanities Pedagogy is characterized by…

* Many tools
* Possibilities
* Options 
* No constraint
* More readings
* Many project partners
* The latest
* Many assignments
* The greatest
* Breathlessness
* Many students
* Tech, tech, tech
* No prior experience necessary; breakneck speed assumed
* Overwhelm
* MOOCs[^1]
* Overwork
* Tomorrow
* No clocks
* Many on the one
* Bursting circles
* No deadlines
* Too many course topics in one
* Feature/scope/course creep
* Yes, and[^2]
* "How do we scale this up?"
* Much
* Up
* Fast
* Full

I wholeheartedly agree, but I need to think further in order to reconcile this with my own thinking above. Perhaps, before yes, and one should ask we?
