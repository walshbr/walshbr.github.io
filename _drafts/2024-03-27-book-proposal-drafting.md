direct vs indirect instruction

alternative approaches to grading?

open question - how is this different from the digital pedagogy in the humanities and their keyword approach?
  - that is about 

maybe take a single topic/assignment and approach teaching it in each way (three in each chapter maybe?)

From Laura - is something lost when we go minimal? is there still space for joy? excitement? for taking an idea and running with it? Is there a way to make space in our curriculum and educational landscape for that? Is this diametrically opposed (brandon thinks probably not)

From Danica - I love this piece, Brandon! I know this isn't exactly what you're writing about, but it makes me think about how my minimalist pedagogy is actually in service of a maximalist world: more resources, leisure time, and joy (and/or a more even distribution of those) within our society.
