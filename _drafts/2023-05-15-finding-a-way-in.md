Premise 1: Digital humanities is a vast are of work. There is an enormous and ever-growing group of people and institutions doing digital work across across a broad range of languages, disciplines, and methods.

Premise 2: Everyone learns something for the first time. [^1]

How, then, is a student new to digital humanities to find their way? To find their way towards the topic, method, or subject that will interest them? There are, of course, many answer to these questions. I wanted to share one approach I use. 

[Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/), a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. These artifacts are organized around particular topics: going alphabetically, for example, the collection starts with access, affect, annotation, and archive. Each of these keywords contains a range of materials including syllabi, course projects, classroom activities, and more. And each topical section opens with a short headnote by an editor, expert in that field, contextualizing how that particular topic intersects with the broad field of digital pedagogy.

1. Describe your research interests in about a paragraph or so. No need to be lengthy, no need to worry about the audience, and no need to worry about being overly specific. This is for you.

2. Take a few moments to read the table of contents for Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities. 

3. Write down the 3-5 keywords that seem to most closely intersect with your interests. You might even find that you used some of the same terms in the paragraph you wrote for step one. 

4. For each keyword, read the editorial headnote and peruse the artifacts collected under it. You will want to make particular note of the other names and scholars referenced.

Voila! A way in! Even though the resource in question is pedagogical in focus, I find the activity works well for students regardless of their interest in teaching. The activity works especially well for folks with a general curiosity about the field to find a constellation of materials close to their interest. It also can serve to give more theoretical grounding for those who already have an area of method of interest but haven't done much in the way of literature review for the field yet.
