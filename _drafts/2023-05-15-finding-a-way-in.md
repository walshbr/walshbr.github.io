Premise 1: Digital humanities is a vast are of work. It encompasses an enormous and ever-growing group of people and institutions doing digital work across across a broad range of languages, disciplines, and methods.

Premise 2: Everyone learns something for the first time. [^1]

How, then, is a student new to digital humanities supposed to find their way towards the topic, method, or subject that will interest them? 

While there are many answers to these questions, I have come to rely on one activity I often run when meeting with interested students new to the field. The activity relies on _[Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)_, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. I ask the student to compare their own interests to the collection to find a series of subareas within DH that they might want to explore further. The exercise usually all happens in conversation. For the sake of this post and ease of use by others, I'll write it out as a series of steps as though it were an assignment sheet to be given to a student.

## Finding a Way into DH

This exercise will help you map your own research interests onto various areas within Digital Humanities using _[Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)_, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. The site organizes its pedagogical resources around particular topics: going alphabetically, for example, the collection starts with access, affect, annotation, and archive. Each of these keywords contains a range of materials including syllabi, course projects, classroom activities, and more. And each topical section opens with a short headnote by an editor, expert in that field, contextualizing how that particular topic intersects with the broad field of digital pedagogy. We will make use of this structure to connect you to the field.

1. Describe your research interests in about a paragraph or so. No need to be lengthy, no need to worry about the audience, and no need to worry about being overly specific. This is for you.

2. Take a few moments to read the table of contents for _Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities_. What do you notice?

3. Write down the 3-5 keywords that seem to most closely intersect with your interests. You might even find that you used some of the same terms in the paragraph you wrote for step one. Taken together, this set of keywords will be the way that you triangulate one view of your relationship to DH. 

4. For each keyword you circled, read the editorial headnote and peruse the artifacts collected under it. You will want to make particular note of the other projects and scholars referenced. You can practice [citation chaining](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/litreview/citation-chaining#:~:text=Citation%20chaining%20is%20the%20process,This%20is%20called%20backward%20chaining.) to use this list to further enmesh yourself within your growing network of interests within DH.

Even though the resource in question is pedagogical in focus, I find the activity works well for students regardless of their interest in teaching. It works especially well for folks with a general curiosity about the field to find a constellation of materials close to their interest. It also can serve to give more theoretical grounding for those who already have an area of method of interest but haven't done much in the way of literature review for the field yet. The exercise does not aim to be a comprehensive survey of the field. Instead, it starts from the premise that the only way to begin is by beginningâ€“new students often just need guideposts to get started.
