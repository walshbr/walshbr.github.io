Praxis is wrapping up its unit on community building within digital humanities. This section of the year has the following activating questions:

> What constitutes a community in DH? how will we design one together? how do DHers articulate these practices in public? how do you publish on DH community? how do you find your way into these communities as individuals just starting out? 

And this cohort specifically engaged in the following questions: 

> who are we? who are we not? who is in the room? who is not? what assumptions does the room make? what is the nature of our community? how will we build and maintain and generous and equitable environment? what are our hopes and dreams? our daily practices? how do I intersect with the group as an individual? how does the group intersect with the world outside? how do I? How are communities formed and reformed?

The cohort explored these topics by way of designing a group charter, a statement of values that they want to put into practice together over the course of the year, and designing plans for self-study based on various presentations from the lab community. The goal is for them to examine how the various communities within the lab and the field more generally intersect and how they might find their own particular way of intervening. 

We're about to move onto to a new unit on teaching and learning, but I wanted to offer a few words on how things all fit together. We cover a variety of topics throughout the year:

* Communities
* Teaching and learning
* Research Infrastructure
* Practice (under which I'm broadly including the technical curriculum for the year)

Of course, it's impossible to separate any one of these segments from the others. We might visualize their interconnectedness like this (pardon my handwriting).

So as we shift out of focusing on community and towards the other units this year I wanted to offer a few questions one might ask toward how to activate community considerations in the other topics that are forthcoming.

* Teaching and learning - what assumptions do our pedagogies make about who is in the room? how do our physical learning include or exclude? what are small community-building practices we can implement each day to create the collective we want? how might we draft community agreements like charters with our students? do our syllabi fulfill the same purpose? if not, why is that?

* Research Infrastructure

Take any given solo-authored research activity - what is the large, unstated community of collaborators behind that work? how might we most generously credit all those involved in digital work? how does the institutional position of digital work affect the nature of the work and who is allowed to participate in it? what audience do we imagine for our work? how might any given research activity cultivate a specific community that will live beyond the work? what kinds of values documents–MOUs, charters, etc–can we offer to help intentionally shape our research practices?

* Practice 

How do the technical choices we make reinforce or undercut systemic power imblanaces? how can we make our technical practice as inclusive as possible? what daily practices might we implement to turn solitary activities into collective ones (paired programming, code review, etc)? how do our past histories with digital methods inform, strengthen, or frustrate our efforts to put them into practice today? how can we pay forward our successes to others and learn from our failures?

I'll leave it there since each of these topics will get their own post later on and I'm trying to stick with shorter posts this year.
