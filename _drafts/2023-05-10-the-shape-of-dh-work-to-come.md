Building on the "What is Praxis Working on?" post to contextualize some changes to the program this past year. 

Limitations of project-based approach to DH to reach group of students from many disciplines

The nature of the different kinds of work DH folks do - we don't just work on projects.

Connect to Buttonology - methods might change, but underlying core pieces of DH work do not.

Expansive definition of DH method beyond the methods used for research

Focus is on a portfolio not projects. Really has always been the focus but that was hard to see when one piece of the portfolio took up 50% of the year. 

Project-based pedagogy not pedagogy-based projects.

In practical terms - 
- moving away from a digital project as such in the spring. 
- de-emphasizes the primacy of what was always meant to be only one component of the year
- expanding the other sections and give them proper deliverables

Coda on how this is more sustainable.
