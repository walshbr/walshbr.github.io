Probably going to be a response to https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:27045/ but that linked poster is down. I think the real place to find it is probably in the volume forthcoming in Dec of 2023.

difference in structure

any presentation or discussion of DH is a space of teaching
curricula
credit-bearing courses
one-off sessions
weeklong DH workshops - DreamLab, DHSI, HILT
ongoing mentorship
ad hoc, self-teaching

difference in instituional context
SLAC scene
departmental, library
What would the point of this post be? Is the idea that DH teaching is limited by the shape it takes? It feels like since this is more of an introductory passage for the project, so it make sense to hold onto until later.
