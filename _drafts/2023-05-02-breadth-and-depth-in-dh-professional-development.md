I'm going to try to re-enter blogging by intentionally writing shorter pieces more regularly. Bear with me as I try to find a voice in this new, artificially shorter medium. I'll be breaking things that might otherwise be longer pieces into smaller nuggets meant to convey a single topic and linking them together. I thought I would start off by trying to document some tools and ideas that I regularly use in conversations with students, starting with how I discuss professional development with students.

Discussions with students interested in digital humanities careers often start with one key question: what kinds of jobs are out there? There are a number of ways to approach to the topic, but I'm going to touch on just one in this post and save others for future writing. 
I usually start conversations about careers in DH by drawing a diagram.

The diagram

The constellation of work involved in any given Digital humanities position can be described in terms of a relationship between breadth and depth. 

* Breadth: generalized work across many different DH topics or methods
* Depth: deep focus on a particular DH area

All DH positions will ask you for some combination of these two variables, and any particular position will ask for a specific configuration of expertise keyed to these axes. I actually think there is a degree of tension between the two categories. You can't possibly know everything about everything (and if a job seems to be asking that of you it is a major red flag). And I intend no real value judgement in any direction. The depth metaphor does not correlate to value or intellectual rigor: a position asking for specific expertise is not inherently better than one asking for broad surface familiarity.

I then pull up our own staff page and chart a few positions along these axes. Some examples:

DH Faculty

Faculty positions in digital humanities are generally characterized by deep expertise and focused work in a particular topic. A DH faculty member might, say, work extensively on digital mapping but have only passing knowledge of digital text analysis. This is not to say that a faculty position will not ask a person to have broad knowledge of DH as a field and its methods–such a person might be called upon to design a DH curriculum or read DH grant applications on a broad array of topics. But a faculty position is more likely to expect and reward specialization.

DH Librarian diagram

By contrast, librarians are more likely to be pulled in many directions and asked to know a little about a lot of things. A librarian is provides support to whatever researchers come through the door. For example, I am not really a digital archives or digital mapping person, but I know enough about these methods to be able to have introductory consults with people and point them towards the right tools. While I do have my own specialities–digital pedagogy and text analysis–I think my position just as much asks me to have surface-level knowledge of many areas. My position involves a mix of administrative, teaching, and development work. That work is often quite general, skewed towards breadth as opposed to depth.

GIS Specialist / Developer diagram

Another example We have two GIS specialists in our Lab that work on digital mapping needs for the entire university. These are highly specialized positions. The bread and butter of their positions entails deep work on a small number of methods. Another good example might be a DH developer hired to work on a specific DH grant project with a particular tech stack. 

Of course, the tension between breadth and depth is further inflected by a range of other variables. The institution, might affect things, as a Library will have a different portfolio of work than, say, an art museum. Scale is another important factor, as the larger an institution's staff the more likely it is for positions to be more highly specialized. 

As with all binaries, this one breaks down under too much scrutiny. But I've still found it to be a useful starting point for getting students to think through the different flavors of futures for which they might prepare. In a future post I'll discuss how students might translate this model into a scaffolded plan for their own professional development.
