If you've followed me on social media for any length of time you likely know that I am a musician. I play horns with [The Hard Modes](https://thehardmodes.com/), a group that does original jazz arrangements of video game music. There's some slight overlap between my time with that group and my work in the DH world, insofar as people in the DH community often tend to enjoy video game music (Quinn Dombrowski even had us perform for the [Animal Crossing: New Digital Humanities](https://www.twitch.tv/acndighum) series). But the COVID-19 Pandemic and resultant social distancing the last few years really made the work feel more DH-y as we tried to find ways to keep playing together remotely even while it was unsafe to do so in person. We wound up releasing an album of these remote recordings called The Lan Sessions. Greg Weaver, our bandleader, arranger, and saxophonist, talks a bit about the process in his [blog post](https://thehardmodes.com/blog/2021/1/19/enter-the-lan-sessions) introducing the subject. 

I learned during the process of those tracks about home recording, music production, and music technology. I found it all fascinating, especially the complicated chain of events necessary to make one of these art objects come to life. For the purposes of this post, I wanted to extract from that experience a generalized workflow for others interested in remote recording projects. Full credit here goes to Greg for his guidance in how to do this work - he helped me troubleshoot throughout, and I am mostly documenting the process he shared with me (for myself as well as others). I will stay fairly high level: I won't be telling which buttons to click in which program for the simple fact that each step along the way is fairly complex. Instead, I'll just aim to give a broad outline of the steps with some context for why they are necessary. One last caveat: I'm sure there are other ways to do this work. This is just the one we used.

## The Workflow

1. Complete the arrangement. 

Perhaps obvious, but it helps to have some sense of what your arrangement will be before moving to prepare things for recording. There is some variation in how this looks. You might do things entirely on a piano. Or you might arrange entirely in a program meant for sheet music before sending to a different piece of software to prepare the recording process. Or you could arrange entirely in a Digital Audio Workstation and skip the initial process of making sheet music. This muddies the waters somewhat, as the arranging and mixing happens in the same piece of software. For our purposes we used two different programs and had to export work between them. In any case, for this workflow you will want to have some sense of the arrangement and the parts before you sit down to start tinkering. 

2. Create sheet music for the score and parts. The next step involves taking your arrangement from abstract idea (e.g. we will play a melody over these chords followed by two soloists and then end) and making it into concrete parts for your players. For this I use Finale, a music notation software. There are othersâ€“Musescore or Sibelius might come to mind. These programs are *deep*. After years I feel I am only beginning to scratch the surface of how to use them. They let you edit together a score and series of parts
 At the end of this step your goal is to have a sc

Uses Finale.
Export that sheet music as a MIDI file.
Import that Midi information into Logic.
Each part gets its own track
Double check that things worked correctly.
Modify the arrangement so that it works out as expected.

Now you have a mockup template for the group. Export the project.
Each person gets the project tracks to import into their Digital Audio Workstation
They mute the track corresponding to their particular instrument and record over it, sending their materials into a shared folder. 
The collected multitrack recording builds up from there.
We had the rhythm section and melody players do a pass, followed by the soloists, followed by rhythm section again.
From there you might send the materials off to be mixed and/or engineered by others if you want a particular consistency to the audio.
Lastly, if there is any video editing to be done someone will have to do that.
