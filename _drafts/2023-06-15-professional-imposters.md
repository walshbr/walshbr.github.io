Not sure what that term means, but it is a thing that feels provocative. so you might just plan on doing some free writing on it.

Maybe also a point there about how the profession cultivates a sense of certain kinds of people as imposters?

Reference that library article on how imposter syndrome as a term cultivates something at the level of the individual.

How does DH / the digital library cultivate a sense of imposterdom?
What does it mean to be working as an imposter? Is there a difference in terms between a PROFESSIONAL imposter and mere imposter syndrome?
