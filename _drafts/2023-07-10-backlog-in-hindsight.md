Michael Levenson, my dissertation director, always had great ice breakers. One I remember, in particular, opened a graduate class on Henry James and Joseph Conrad: "What do you read for?" Separate from research questions per se, this was an invitation to think about what made a passage pop to us, what tended to lie at the core of our interest in particular things. I remember saying that I tended to find myself writing about problems, puzzles at the core of passage that didn't make sense. A friend noted how he was drawn to conflict and politics. Another cited interpersonal relations as the thing that drew them in. I found myself in how rarely I thought about the fundamental basis for finding myself to particular topics and research areas. What is it that makes one put down the book and pick up the pen?

For over two years now I've been writing for [Backlog](https://www.backlogmag.com/), "a video game newsletter for people who are behind on videogames." Writing about a different subject for a public audience has been invigorating, not least because it forces me into new topics than I would otherwise have posted on in this space. Now that I've published to Backlog ten times (with an eleventh piece on the way), I thought I might take the opportunity to step back and apply Levenson's exercise to my writing on video games. It's easy enough to pick out the genres of games that I like: role playing, soulsborne, and simulation to name a few. But, besides play, what drives my curiousity? What makes me put down the controller and text the Backlog editor with an idea? In what follows I'll take the list of publications, group them loosely based on topic, and offer a few quick reflections.
