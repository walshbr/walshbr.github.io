DMd Ronda about cowriting

One thing I noticed in meetings

* scrum
* agenda
* lazy consensus
* Time keeping; recognize what needs more conversation in the future; can someone take this on? What do we need to close this conversation?
* saying no is a super power
* what are next steps?
* actionables
* make sure everyone has pieces to work on
* the hard ask


Ronda notes

* Gathering - getting people mentally in the room; how to get people settled in the room.
