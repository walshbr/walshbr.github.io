I've always been someone who learns best while listening. And as I've gotten older and busier I've had more and more need to find ways to keep up with work while taking care of household activities. In the last six months I've started to do a deep dive into the DH resources out there available as audio, things that I can absorb during the cracks of the day. In the hopes of finding more, I posted to Mastodon asking if anyone had favorite recordings of DH talks, lectures, or workshops. The post got fair amount of recirculation but no actual replies with links. That tells me there might be others interested in such materials, so I thought I would start a little running list of what I've been checking out and share with others. Keep in mind there is no real attempt at coverage here: it roughly collects whatever I've managed to check out whenever I manage to check it out (I would love to hear what I'm missing!). And I also won't be keeping track, say, if things get taken down years from now. The scope is also quite broad but also idiosyncratic: there's a clear focus on DH infrastructure and digital pedagogy given my own work. 

I'm using a service called [BibBase](https://bibbase.org/) to embed my zotero collection on this page, so this post should be updated in the future as that collection updates. You can also explore the collection [directly on Zotero's website](https://www.zotero.org/bmw9t/collections/GYNETXY7). And I would recommend [this guide](https://yvonneseale.org/blog/2016/10/23/how-to-embed-a-zotero-bibliography-in-a-web-page/
) by Yvonne Seale if you want to embed a zotero bibliography in this same way on a page of your own.
