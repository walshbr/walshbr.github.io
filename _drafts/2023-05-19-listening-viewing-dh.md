I've always been someone who learns best while listening. I'm also a chronic multitaskerâ€“I'm always cleaning or cooking while I listen to lectures.A while back I posted to Mastodon asking if anyone had favorite recordings of DH talks, lectures, or workshops. The post got fair amount of recirculation but no actual replies with links. That tells me there might be others interested in such materials, so I thought I would start a little documentation to keep track of the things I've listened to.

As is the case with universal design
