**From the Year of Book Blogging**

1. Where does DH teaching happen?
    2. Where does infrastructural change happen?
1. Classroom experience
    2. Pedagogies of listening
    3. How do we make the classroom a space where students can be sheltered from the academy and also create the conditions to transform it a la [Jacqueline Wernimont](https://jwernimont.com/)?
    4. What are the spaces of teaching, for DH in particular?
2. Labor
    1. DH students as DH teachers
    2. Neoliberal DH pedagogies
    3. Expanding on the UCLA Student Collaborators' Bill of Rights
    4. Precarious labor and the labor of teaching
3. Infrastructure
    1. As it impacts pedagogy and student life and teaching in particular; how do the small decisions we make at the level of administration reflect our pedagogies?
    2. How can pedagogy be enacted beyond the classroom? How can we take teacherly actions as administrators?
    3. How can those teacherly administrative actions address issues of precarity among the student population?
4. Profession
    1. Professional Imposters
    2. Small changes / big changes
5. Conclusion â€“ on inclusivity
    1. How do we invite students into the profession and into higher education in a way that makes their voices heard and valued?
    2. How can we ensure students are valued in online spaces? Or welcomed in spaces of open peer review?
    3. Where to go from here?
