From katina on the maximalism post

Iâ€™m so intrigued by the last footnote on yes, and
4:16
like I wonder about a counterpoint where maximalism opens doors to new voices and unexpected outcomes, and an uncritical application of minimalism narrows to a strictly canonical approach (for example)
4:17
and where the sweet spot of letting in a bit of an improv mentality might loosen the strictures in a valuable way

this is so thoughtful and good.  I think it applies (obvs) to more than dh contexts, this idea that pedagogical maximalism often comes from circumstances beyond our control.  I think about profs who say "I'm behind in my class!" because they have so much content they think they need to plow through.

Great piece @walshbr.bsky.social . I really enjoyed the consideration of minimalist related to DH but beyond. Or how DH should be connected to a powerful thinking process

I really like this because I feel like some of our ILS courses here just throw lots of tools at students for the sake of exposure. But it tends to make students anxious and literally overload a lot of their computers because they have to download a bunch of programs they'll never use again!
