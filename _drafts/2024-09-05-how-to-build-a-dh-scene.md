I'm in the middle of listening to an audiobook of David Byrne's [How Music Works](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/535976/how-music-works-by-david-byrne/9780804188937/). The book is a fascinating glimpse into the music industry, but I almost had to pull my car over when he started talking about digital humanities centers. 

Okay–Byrne was actually in the middle of a whole chapter describing the special character of CBGB, the renowned music club that opened in 1973 and that was the frequent haunt of punk and new wave bands. But I was struck by just resonant so much of his advice for cultivating a special and identifiable community was to me, someone who spends a lot of time working to do the same with students new to digital humanities. Once I parked, I quickly made some notes riffing on Byrne's own eight characteristics of a successful music scene. I'll share Byrne's elements below and then riff on them as they relate to our own practice of cultivating collective DH experiences. 

1. There must be a venue that is of appropriate size and location in which to present material.
2. The artists should be allowed to play their own material.
3. Performing musicians must get in for free on their off nights (and maybe get free beer too)
4. There must be a sense of alientation from the prevailing music scene
5. Rent must be low – and it must stay low
6. Bands must be paid fairly
7. Social transparency must be encouraged
8. It must be possible to ignore the band when necessary
