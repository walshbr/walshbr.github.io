Co-teaching is a promise. To each other. To yourself. To believe. To trust. To support. To help. To heal. 

Co-teaching is not a weapon. 

Co-teaching is a gift. 

Co-teaching is not a competition.

Co-teaching is an act of love. 

Co-teaching is not a zero sum game. 

Co-teaching is seeing the world through the eyes of another. The classroom. Yourself. 

Co-teaching is an act of vulnerability. An exposure. 

Co-teaching is an invitation. 

Co-teaching is an act of empathy. 

Co-teaching is extending your arms openly. It is not pushing someone away. 

Co-teaching is a beautiful game. It is not a game of chance. 

Co-teaching is embracing the unknown. 

Co-teaching is finding yourself in the shoes of another.

Co-teach is recognizing that you have power. 

Co-teaching is not a tug of war. 

Teaching is learning. 

Co-teaching is learning to teach.
