After some Git problems were sorted out and explained to me by the staff of the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/">Scholars' Lab</a>, I can make updates to the site again. I have added some content to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pedagogy">Pedagogy</a> page: the syllabus for my current writing course among other goodies. Enjoy!
